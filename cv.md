#### About
I worked as a logist in some courier-companies more than 15 years. I also had my own small company (is sold in 2016). 
But I began burnout at this work. Last year I decided to change my field of activity. Since I took part in the description of business-processes for software-developers and I was really interessed in this process, so I decided to become a developer. Earlier I also made a couple of sites for my ex-company, so I choose the frontend-development.
