#### About

I worked as a logist in some courier-companies more than 15 years. I also had my own small company (is sold in 2016). 
But I began burnout at this work. Last year I decided to change my field of activity. Since I took part in the description of business-processes for software-developers and I was really interessed in this process, so I decided to become a developer. Earlier I also made a couple of websites for my ex-company, so I choose the frontend-development. Since I often encountered flaws in existing programs in my work, ideally I would like to develop an application for a courier company using all the experience gained in past professional activities.

#### Hard skills
I began learning a few months ago and got main knowledges in:
* HTML & CSS:
    * tags
    * BEM
    * Pug
    * selectors
    * Less
    * Scss
    * Flex
    * Grid
    
* Markdown
* Figma
* Git
* JS
* start to learn Webpack and React 

#### Code Example

There is an example of my code from Codewars:

Your task is to rotate a matrix 90 degree to the left. The matrix is an array of integers with dimension n,m. So this kata checks some basics, it's not too difficult
```
var rotateMatrix = arr => {
  let matrix = [];
  let j = arr[0].length-1;
  for (let k = 0; k < arr[0].length; k++) {  
      matrix[k] = [];
          for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {  
              matrix[k].push(arr[i][j]);      
          } 
      j--;   
  } 
  return matrix;
}

```

#### Editors
   * VS Code (main)
   * WebStorm
