#### About
I worked as a logist in some courier-companies more than 15 years. I also had my own small company (is sold in 2016). 
But I began burnout at this work. Last year I decided to change my field of activity. Since I took part in the description of business-processes for software-developers and I was really interessed in this process, so I decided to become a developer. Earlier I also made a couple of sites for my ex-company, so I choose the frontend-development.

#### Hard skills
I began learning a few months ago and got main knowledges in:
* HTML:
    * tags
    * BEM
* CSS: 
    * selectors
    * Less
* Markdown
    ```	
    let calculateSalary = function (salary) {
	      let percent = 0.35;
	        if (salary >= 100000) {
	          percent = 0.45;
          }
	        let net = Math.round(salary - (salary * percent));
	        return net;
	  };
    ```
    
and basic knowledges in:
* Git
* JS

My main editor is VS Code.
